# Android Applications Implementing Fragments and Permissions

​	Shows how permissions can be implemented to open one app from another. Uses data from the [Smartphone-Info-App](https://github.com/yashchitre03/Smartphone-Info-App) for images, and links. The third application implements the concept of fragments.

​	Fragments show how the screen space can be efficiently utilized to display data depending on the orientation of the smartphone. For example, in portrait mode, only one fragment is displayed at a time, whereas in landscape mode, two fragments can be displayed side by side to show more data.

Refer: 

1. [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments)

2. [Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview)

​	The app works by pressing the button and giving the permission to open other apps. This process is repeated in the second application. 

​	Finally, the fragment application displays the data and gives an option to send intents to the first two applications (to perform function like opening the desired web link).
